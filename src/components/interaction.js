              <h4>CREATE AN EXERCISE</h4>
              <hr />
              <p>
                At the clinic, the physician creates the patient profile on the
                portal and prescribes the treatment plan including the type of
                exercise, repetition, and other parameters.{" "}
              </p>
              <h4>EXERCISE SELECTION</h4>
              <p>
                Exercise selection displays the game visually with customized
                instructions to prevent injuries.
              </p>
              <h4>PARAMETERS</h4>
              <p>
                Parameters customized for every patient (ie. range of motion) to
                maintain performance accuracy without constant monitoring.{" "}

              <h4>GAMIFIED EXERCISE</h4>
              <hr />
              <p>
                The patient downloads the portal and sets up the body sensor
                camera to a computer to begin the exercises. Our software does
                not require any wearables, since the camera is able to detect
                the body and create a virtual model.
              </p>
              <h4>STARS POINT SYSTEM</h4>
              <p>
                Point system to encourage patients to perform the exercises
                accurately and work towards a goal.
              </p>
              <h4>DYNAMIC BAR</h4>
              <p>
                Bar represents the current range of motion compared to the
                parameter goal set by the physician.{" "}

              <h4>REAL-TIME FEEDBACK</h4>
              <hr />
              <p>
                The physician can access the portal remotely to monitor the
                patientâ€™s treatment. Additionally, the patient can also access
                the portal to view the progress over each session and
                communicate with the physician.
              </p>
              <h4> VARIABLES</h4>
              <p>
                The progress report tracks the range of motion, speed, and
                reaction time.{" "}
              </p>
              <h4>TIME PERIODS</h4>

                day, week, month, or year.
