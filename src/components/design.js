          <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
          <p>
            As a concept development tool, I used storyboarding to to visualize
            how patients and physicians, would utilize two aspects of the
            solution â€“ the web portal and gamified exercise. Through this sprint
            activity, I gained clarity on how my design will engage users, and
            aligned on the potential solution with my team.

            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>
              I created high-fidelity functional wireframes with Adobe InDesign.
              Below is a snippet of the desktop experience for two user flows:
              patients and physicians.
            </p>
