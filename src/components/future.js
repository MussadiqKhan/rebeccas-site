            This project has grown much more than the initial idea we formed. In
            August 2018, Clynx was awarded as one of the most promising top 10
            Health Startups in Europe, by EITHealth at the InnoStars Awards
            Competition. We received a $10K grant and incorporated in Portugal.
            In early 2019, we began our beta testing phase with one of the
            clinics at CUF, the largest hospital chain across Portugal, and
            other private clinics in Lisbon.

            I’m immensely grateful to my team and mentors I’ve found along the
            way. Working closely with our PM and engineers, I learned how
            valuable understanding the business goals and technical limitations
            while designing has on the long term value of the solution.
            Currently, I am still the sole designer at Clynx and am excited to
            work on the end-to-end user experience further!
