            <h3>Storytelling + presentation skill</h3>
            <p>
              In order to build upon my storytelling skills, I actively sought
              feedback for my work internally and externally from my immediate
              team. This gave me the opportunity to tailor my presentations in a
              succinct manner to a range of audiences. By the end, I had
              presented each project over 5x to stakeholders across teams.

            <h3>Cross-functional collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              The PM and Eng team within my team was remote which posed
              challenges, but also strengthened my communication skills. Through
              actively seeking feedback during 1:1s and weekly meetings, I was
              able to foster and strengthen my relationships.

            <h3>Prototyping skills</h3>
            <p>
              Based on my teamâ€™s familiarity with existing tools, I learned how
              to prototype more efficiently on Sketch and Principle. During my
              internship, I also learned from Googlers how to use Framer X and
              Procreate, to rapidly sketch ideas!
